						SPG &amp; Marriott Rewards merger: What it means for you

						Travellers who collect Marriott Rewards, The
						Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG)
						will have access to a single unified loyalty program
						come August. The changes are quite dramatic but are
						mostly positive.
					</p>
					<p>
						The new program doesn't have an official name yet, but
						guests will be able to book stays and earn or redeem
						points at all participating 29 global brands which
						covers 6,500 hotels in 127 countries and territories.
					</p>
					<p>
						“We listened to the travel aspirations of our members
						and set our sights on unlocking the full potential of
						our loyalty programs,” said David Flueck, Senior Vice
						President of Global Loyalty, Marriott International.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2><b>When is this change happening?</b></h2>
					<div>
						<p>
							According to Marriott, the change is happening this
							August, but there's no firm date in place yet. When
							that date becomes official, Marriott Rewards, The
							Ritz-Carton Rewards and SPG members will be able to
							merge their accounts into a single loyalty program.
						</p>

						<p>
							<span

									>Juice your credit card loyalty points and
									rewards.</a
								></span
							>
						</p>

						<p>
							A new single digital reservation system will be
							introduced in early 2019, which will making the
							booking process easier as you'll be able to find
							accommodations at all participating properties.
							<br />
							This announcement allows members to take full
							advantage of the new benefits as soon as possible.
							In addition, new exclusive member experiences will
							be introduced throughout the year.
						</p>
					</div>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>What happens to my existing points?</h2>
					<div>
						<p>
							The new program means that a single points currency
							will be introduced. SPG members will need to combine
							their accounts with Marriott come August where their
							points balance will triple. In other words, 1 SPG
							point = 3 Marriott Rewards Points (or whatever the
							new name ends up being).
						</p>
						<p>
							Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards
							members don't need to worry about anything as their
							points will remain the same.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once all of your points are merged, any new points
							you earn will be credited to the combined loyalty
							program.
						</p>
					</div>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>What happens to my status?</h2>
					<div>
						<p>
							The current nights you have accumulated for status
							will be combined, which means you might actually
							qualify for some of the new status tiers right away.
						</p>
						<p>
							Silver elite is now earned at 10 nights, Gold elite
							at 25 nights, Platinum elite at 50, and Platinum
							Premier at 75 nights. Platinum Premier members who
							surpass 100 nights and $20,000 worth of spend will
							become a member of the ambassador program. If you
							had achieved lifetime status, you'll continue to
							have that recognized.
						</p>
						<p>
							Free breakfast will now be offered to Platinum and
							Platinum Premier members and will be expanded to 25
							participating brands.
						</p>
					</div>
				</article>

					<h2>
						How many of the new points do I need to get a free
						night?
					</h2>
					<div>
						<p>
							Under the new program, it'll cost you 7,500 points
							for a free night at a Category 1 hotel while on the
							higher end of things, it'll cost you 85,000 points
							for a Category 8 hotel. It's important to note that
							many hotels will be recategorized to fit within this
							new category scale and there will be no blackout
							dates for points redemptions, meaning you can claim
							a free night any day of the year including holidays.
						</p>
						<p>

								><a href="#">Are Air Miles worth it?</a>
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							For reference, currently it takes 3,000 SPG points
							or 7,500 Marriott points to get a free night at a
							Category 1 hotel.
						</p>
						<p>
							A free night award chart is being introduced in 2019
							where the amount of points required for a free night
							will depend on peak, standard and off-peak pricing
							at all hotels. Generally speaking, off-peak will
							cost you about 20% less in points for a free night
							while the peak season will see a 20% increase.
						</p>
						<p>
							The award chart will start in 2019, so anything
							booked for 2018 will be at the standard pricing for
							a free night.
